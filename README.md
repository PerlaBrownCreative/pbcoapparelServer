# nodemon

nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

nodemon does **not** require *any* additional changes to your code or method of development. nodemon is a replacement wrapper for `node`. To use `nodemon`, replace the word `node` on the command line when executing your script.

# Installation

Either through cloning with git or by using [npm](http://npmjs.org) (the recommended way):

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

And nodemon will be installed globally to your system path.

You can also install nodemon as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

With a local installation, nodemon will not be available in your system path. Instead, the local installation of nodemon can be run by calling it from within an npm script (such as `npm start`) or using `npx nodemon`.
